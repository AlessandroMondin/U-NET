### My personal implementation of UNET! 
The architecture is implemented in model.py and I designed it to facilitate exparimentation, for instance by adding extra-downhills to the encoder.
<br>
I trained it for less than 15 epochs on the DAVIS2017 (used for few-shots video-segmentation), but nevertheless it generalized more than I expected for "person" segmentation. <br><br>
