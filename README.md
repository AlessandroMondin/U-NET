### My personal implementation of UNET! 
The architecture is implemented in model.py and I designed it to facilitate exparimentation, for instance by adding extra-downhills to the encoder.
I trained the model on the DAVIS2017 that is usually used for few-shots video-segmentation and as consequence, but nevertheless it generalized more than I expected for "person" segmentation. <br><br>
